 I have been reading more about ruby and ruby on rails and refreshing my self on html elements such as span and figure, figcaption em etc. I feel like it's a good to go back to the basics so you mind can keep fresh. Often times you can still learn how to do other techniques that may expand your mind at least for me . Another thing about HTML I like is the mailto links so it looks like this <a href="mailto:johndoeworkshopdemo@gmail.com"> the mailto command inside the href also users to send and email to the specifed adress. So clicking on the link starts up your default email program and includes the email adress johndoeworkshopdemo@gmail.com
